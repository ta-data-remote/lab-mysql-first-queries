# Lab | My first queries

Load the *IronHackDB.sql* structure in your local MySQL Workbench database instance. Use the *applestore* (not applestore2) table to query the data about Apple Store Apps and answer the following questions and extensions: 

#7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
# Facebook, Instagram, Clash of Clans are not surprisingly the most rated tracks. They are some kind of outliers compared to the dataset. Obviously, they are the most known and publicly used tracks. 

#8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
#The user rate the tracks very differently (games king of dragon, sudoku) and learning programs are very high rated.

#9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
#It seems that the user ratings and number of votes do not match. Facebook and Co do not have the highest user_rating mark.

#11. Definitely the price  has an impact. The top rated counts as well as user rates are all free (facebook, instagram). The worst rated apps mostly charge some kind of fee.
#The highest apps are either free or cost lower than than 1 Euro. For some special games minecraft, terraria (very well known) users are willing to pay a larger price
## Deliverables 
You need to submit a `.sql` file that includes the queries used to answer the questions above, as well as an `.md` file including your answers.
